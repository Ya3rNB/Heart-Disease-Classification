# Heart-Disease-Classification
A complete machine learning workflow (EDA, Feature Engineering, and Classification) to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project is an end-to-end machine learning workflow designed to classify whether a patient has a high likelihood of heart disease, based on a set of clinical features.

This is a classic **binary classification** problem, focusing on robust feature analysis, model training, and meaningful performance evaluation for a medical dataset. The dataset (`heart.csv`) is included in this repository.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective is to analyze 13 clinical features (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) from the included dataset and build a reliable classification model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease (the `target` variable).
